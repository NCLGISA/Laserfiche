# LFDSSAudit

LFDSSAudit is a tool that will execute a search for documents based on one field, the search syntax can be customized.  It was originally designed to allow employees to turn over a single PDF to auditors before they started to recognize document imaging systems.

The Settings.xml can be placed in a central location and it will be downloaded each time the application starts.

This is relatively old code but may hold useful for some organization as a starting point.
